# Remove Unwanted Characters from Text

## Overview

This repository contains a Power Query M formula designed to remove unwanted characters from strings, specifically targeting non-numeric characters and letters while preserving numeric characters.

In many data processing tasks, especially when working with IDs or other numerical fields, it's essential to remove unwanted characters while preserving only numeric values. However, handling ASCII characters can introduce complexities, especially when dealing with columns that might contain both letters and numbers, special symbols, or other ASCII characters.

This formula cleans a text column by removing all unwanted characters, leaving only the numbers, while excluding non-numeric ASCII characters.

## Purpose of the Formula

This is particularly useful when dealing with identification numbers, codes, or any other numeric data that may contain unwanted characters.

## Case Studies ðŸ“Š

1. ðŸ†” Cleaning national identification numbers that may contain spaces or special characters.
2. ðŸ“ž Standardizing phone numbers by removing parentheses, dashes, or country codes.
3. ðŸ“¦ Sanitizing product codes that might include letters or symbols.
4. ðŸ’³ Extracting pure numeric data from credit card numbers that include spaces or dashes.
5. ðŸ§¾ Taxpayer ID Validation: Cleaning up taxpayer ID columns by removing stray characters to leave only valid numbers.
6. ðŸ“Š Data Entry Clean-up: Ensure clean numeric inputs in datasets where user error might introduce spaces or special characters.
7. ðŸ”¢ Data Transformation for Numeric Columns: Remove unwanted ASCII characters in preparation for statistical or financial analysis.


## Generic Code

```
#"Unwanted Characters Removed" = Table.TransformColumns(
    #"Previous Step Name",
    {
        {"ColumnName", each Text.Remove(_, 
            {
                Character.FromNumber(32) .. Character.FromNumber(47),
                Character.FromNumber(58) .. Character.FromNumber(255)
            }
        ), type text}
    }
)
```

## Example of Code

```
#"Caracteres no deseados removidos" = Table.TransformColumns(
    #"Tipo cambiado1", 
    {
        {"Cedula", each Text.Remove(_, 
            {
                Character.FromNumber(32) .. Character.FromNumber(47),
                Character.FromNumber(58) .. Character.FromNumber(255)
            }
        ), type text}
    }
)
```

## Notes

- Adjust the `"Previous Step Name"` to match the name of the step before this transformation in your query.
- Replace `"ColumnName"` with the name of the column you want to clean.
- The formula removes characters with ASCII values:
  - From 32 to 47 (which includes space and special characters)
  - From 58 to 255 (which includes letters and other special characters)
- ASCII values 48 to 57 (representing digits 0-9) are preserved.
- If you need to keep additional characters, adjust the ranges in the `Character.FromNumber()` functions.
