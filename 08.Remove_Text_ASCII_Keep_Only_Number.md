# Remove Unwanted Characters from Text

## Overview

This repository contains a Power Query M formula designed to remove unwanted characters from text, specifically targeting non-numeric characters while preserving ASCII numeric characters.

## Purpose of the Formula

The formula aims to clean text data by removing all characters except for numeric ASCII characters (0-9). This is particularly useful when dealing with identification numbers, codes, or any other numeric data that may contain unwanted characters.

## Case Studies ðŸ“Š

1. ðŸ†” Cleaning national identification numbers that may contain spaces or special characters.
2. ðŸ“ž Standardizing phone numbers by removing parentheses, dashes, or country codes.
3. ðŸ“¦ Sanitizing product codes that might include letters or symbols.
4. ðŸ’³ Extracting pure numeric data from credit card numbers that include spaces or dashes.

## Generic Code

```
#"Unwanted Characters Removed" = Table.TransformColumns(
    #"Previous Step Name",
    {
        {"ColumnName", each Text.Remove(_, 
            {
                Character.FromNumber(32) .. Character.FromNumber(47),
                Character.FromNumber(58) .. Character.FromNumber(255)
            }
        ), type text}
    }
)
```

## Example of Code

```
#"Caracteres no deseados removidos" = Table.TransformColumns(
    #"Tipo cambiado1", 
    {
        {"Cedula", each Text.Remove(_, 
            {
                Character.FromNumber(32) .. Character.FromNumber(47),
                Character.FromNumber(58) .. Character.FromNumber(255)
            }
        ), type text}
    }
)
```

## Notes

- Adjust the `"Previous Step Name"` to match the name of the step before this transformation in your query.
- Replace `"ColumnName"` with the name of the column you want to clean.
- The formula removes characters with ASCII values:
  - From 32 to 47 (which includes space and special characters)
  - From 58 to 255 (which includes letters and other special characters)
- ASCII values 48 to 57 (representing digits 0-9) are preserved.
- If you need to keep additional characters, adjust the ranges in the `Character.FromNumber()` functions.
