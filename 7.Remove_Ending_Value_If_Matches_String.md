# Remove Ending Value from String

## Overview

This repository contains a Power Query M formula that removes a specific value from the end of a string, but only if it matches exactly. This can be particularly useful when cleaning and standardizing address data or any text-based information where you need to remove certain suffixes conditionally.

## Purpose of the Formula

The purpose of this formula is to provide a flexible way to remove a specific ending from strings in a column, but only when that ending is present. This allows for more precise data cleaning and standardization, especially in scenarios where the ending might be a valid part of the data in some cases.

## Case Studies üìä

Here are some concrete business use cases where this formula can be invaluable:

1. üè† Address Standardization: Remove street type abbreviations (e.g., "St" for Street) from addresses.
2. üìÅ File Name Cleaning: Remove file extensions when they're not needed for processing.
3. üè¢ Company Name Normalization: Remove legal entity types (e.g., "Inc", "LLC") from company names for consistent analysis.
4. üìû Phone Number Formatting: Remove country codes or area codes when they're always the same in a dataset.

## Generic Code

```
= Table.TransformColumns(
    SourceTable,
    {{"TargetColumn", 
      each if Text.EndsWith(_, EndingToRemove) 
           then Text.Start(_, Text.Length(_) - Text.Length(EndingToRemove)) 
           else _,
      type text}}
)
```

## Example of Code

```
= Table.TransformColumns(
    #"Texto recortado",
    {{"Address", 
      each if Text.EndsWith(_," St") 
           then Text.Start(_,Text.Length(_)-3) 
           else _,
      type text}}
)
```

## Notes

- To adjust this code for your needs:
  - Replace `#"Texto recortado"` with the name of your source table step.
  - Change `"Address"` to the name of the column you want to transform.
  - Modify `" St"` to the ending you want to remove.
  - Adjust `3` in `Text.Length(_)-3` to match the length of your ending.
- This formula preserves the original value if the specified ending is not found.
- The formula is case-sensitive. For case-insensitive matching, you'd need to modify the `Text.EndsWith` function.
- Consider performance implications when applying this to large datasets.
