# M - Verifying if Column Starts with a Number Using Power Query

## Problem Description
You have a data table where you need to verify if the values in a specific column start with a number. This verification is crucial for further data processing tasks where only numeric starting values are required, and non-numeric starting values need to be flagged or removed.

## Business Use Cases

#### 游릭 Invoice Processing:
 In accounts payable, invoices may have an identifier where the format starts with a number for valid invoices. Verifying that invoice numbers start with a numeric value can ensure proper categorization and processing.

#### 游릭 Product Codes: 
In inventory management, product codes might start with a number to signify a specific category or type. Ensuring product codes follow this format helps maintain data integrity and simplifies inventory tracking.

#### 游릭 Customer IDs: 
For customer management systems, customer IDs may be formatted to start with a number to differentiate between individual and corporate clients. This verification helps in segmenting and managing customer data effectively.

#### 游릭 Order Numbers: 
In e-commerce or retail, order numbers often start with a numeric prefix to distinguish between different types of orders (e.g., online vs. in-store). Verifying this can streamline order processing workflows.

#### 游릭 Transaction Codes: 
In banking and finance, transaction codes might be prefixed with numbers to identify different types of transactions. Ensuring the correct format aids in accurate transaction recording and reporting.

## Solution
To achieve this, we'll use Power Query Editor and the M language. We'll add a new column to the data table that checks if the values in the specified column start with a number. If the value starts with a number, it will return true; otherwise, it will return "Delete".


### M Code 

```
let
    Source = Data,

    // Add column to verify if cell starts with a number. Returns true if so
    StartsWithNumber = Table.AddColumn(Source, "ColName", each try Value.Is(Number.FromText(Text.Start([Column], 1)), Number.Type) otherwise "Delete"),

in
    StartsWithNumber

```


## Tech
#### Power Query
A data transformation and cleansing tool built into Microsoft Excel and Power BI. It provides a graphical interface for creating and manipulating data transformations.

#### M Language
A functional programming language used by Power Query to create custom data transformations. It is a powerful tool that allows for complex data manipulation, filtering, and aggregation.
