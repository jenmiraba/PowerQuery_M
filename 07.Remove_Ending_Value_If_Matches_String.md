# Remove Ending Value from String if Ending Matches a String

## Overview

This repository contains a Power Query M formula that removes a specific value from the end of a string, but only if it matches exactly. This can be particularly useful when cleaning and standardizing any text-based information where you need to remove certain suffixes conditionally.

## Purpose of the Formula

This formula provides a flexible way to remove a specific ending from strings in a column, but only when that ending is present. This allows for more precise data cleaning and standardization, especially in scenarios where the ending might be a valid part of the data in some cases.

## Business Use Cases

Here are some concrete business use cases where this formula can be invaluable:

1. üè† Address Standardization: Remove street-type abbreviations (e.g., "St" for Street) from addresses.
2. üìÅ File Name Cleaning: Remove file extensions when not needed for processing.
3. üè¢ Company Name Normalization: Remove legal entity types (e.g., "Inc", "LLC") from company names for consistent analysis.
4. üìû Phone Number Formatting: Remove country codes or area codes when they're always the same in a dataset.

## Generic Code

First, we declare a variable with the suffix to remove:
```
EndingToRemoveAsText = "SomeText"
```

Then:

```
= Table.TransformColumns(
    SourceTable,
    {{"TargetColumn", 
      each if Text.EndsWith(_, EndingToRemoveAsText) 
           then Text.Start(_, Text.Length(_) - Text.Length(EndingToRemoveAsText)) 
           else _,
      type text}}
)
```

## Code Example

```
= Table.TransformColumns(
    Source,
    {{"Address", 
      each if Text.EndsWith(_," St") 
           then Text.Start(_,Text.Length(_)-3) 
           else _,
      type text}}
)
```

## Notes

- To adjust this code for your needs:
  - Replace SourceTable with the name of your source table step.
  - Change TargetColumn to the name of the column you want to transform.
  - Change EndingToRemoveAsText to the ending you want to remove.
- This formula preserves the original value if the specified ending is not found.
- The formula is case-sensitive by default. For case-insensitive matching, you can modify the Text.EndsWith function to use Comparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase. This will treat "St", "ST", "st", etc., as the same ending. For example:
  
```
Text.EndsWith("Main St", " ST", Comparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)
```
