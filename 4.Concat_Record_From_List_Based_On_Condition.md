# M - Create a Custom Column Based on List Content Records

## Problem Description
This repository contains an M Language Power Query script that adds a custom column to a table. The new column is created based on the content of a list in an existing column, where the list elements are combined into a single string if certain conditions are met.

Imagine a scenario where you are reading data from an API that provides various types of LinkedIn posts. The data includes a list with different post types such as text only, text + photo, text + carousel, only carousel, etc. Each post type is stored as a record within a list in a column named LinkedinPostType.

You need to create a new column that combines the names of the first two post types in the list for each row. If a row contains only one post type, the new column should reflect that single type. This script helps automate this process by dynamically creating the custom column based on the content of the LinkedinPostType list.

## Purpose
The purpose of this script is to add a new column to a table by processing a list of records in an existing column. This can be useful when you need to generate a summary or concatenated string from list elements within each row.


### M Code - Example Transform Column

The following M code is tailored for the scenario described in Problem Description.
"name" is the name of the field we want to extract from the records.
"Linkedin Post Type" the name of our column.

```
let
    Source = YourSourceTable,
    
    transfCol = Table.TransformColumns(
        Source, 
        {"Linkedin Post Type", 
        each try if List.Count(_) <= 1 then _{0}[name]
        else Text.Combine({_{0}[name], " + ", _{1}[name]})
        otherwise null, type text}
    )

in
    transfCol

```

### M Code - Example AddColumn

```
let
    Source = YourSourceTable,

    customCol = 
    Table.AddColumn(
        Source, 
        "Linkedin Post Type", 
        each try if List.Count([Linkedin Type]) <= 1 then [Linkedin Type]{0}[name]
        else Text.Combine({
            [Linkedin Type]{0}[name], 
            " + ",
            [Linkedin Type]{1}[name]})
        otherwise null
    )

in
    customCol

```

### M Code - Generic Cases

```
// Transform Column
let
    Source = YourSourceTable,
    
    transfCol = Table.TransformColumns(
        Source, 
        {"YourListColumn", 
        each try if List.Count(_) <= 1 then _{0}[YourFieldName]
        else Text.Combine({_{0}[YourFieldName], " + ", _{1}[YourFieldName]})
        otherwise null, type text}
    )

in
    transfCol


// Add Column
let
    Source = YourSourceTable,

    customCol = 
        Table.AddColumn(
            Source, 
            "NewColumn", 
            each try if List.Count([YourListColumn]) <= 1 then [YourListColumn]{0}[YourFieldName]
            else Text.Combine({
                [YourListColumn]{0}[YourFieldName], 
                " + ", 
                [YourListColumn]{1}[YourFieldName]
            })
            otherwise null
        )
in
    customCol


```

## Notes

Code includes a basic example of how to combine elements from a list of records. You may need to modify the script to suit your specific requirements, such as adjusting the fields extracted from the records, the conditions for combining the elements or the result you want to get.
