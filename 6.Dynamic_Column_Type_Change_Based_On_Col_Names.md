# Dynamically Changing Column Types Based on Name or Value List

## Overview

This repository contains a Power Query formula that dynamically changes column data types based on column names or a list of values. The formula is handy when converting a set of columns to a specific data type based on a common pattern in their names and where manual conversion would be time-consuming and error-prone.

## Purpose of the Formula

The purpose of this formula is to automate the process of changing column types in Power Query, enhancing data quality and consistency. By targeting columns based on specific criteria (e.g., starting with a particular word), you can save time and reduce the risk of manual errors. It allows users to:

1. Select columns based on a specific naming pattern (e.g., all columns starting with "Quantity").
2. Dynamically change the data type of selected columns (e.g., to number type).

This automation saves time and reduces errors in data preprocessing tasks.

## Business Use Cases

1. üè≠ Manufacturing: Quickly convert all "Quantity" columns to number type for inventory analysis.
2. üí∞ Finance: Standardize "Amount" columns across multiple reports for accurate calculations.
3. üìà Sales: Ensure all "Revenue" columns are in the correct format for trend analysis.
4. üìÖ Dates: Ensure all "Date" columns have the correct date type. 

## Generic Code

```powerquery
let
    Source = YourTableName,
    TargetColumns = List.Select(Table.ColumnNames(Source), each Text.StartsWith(_, "YourPrefix")),
    TransformedTable = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Source, List.Transform(TargetColumns, each {_, YourDesiredType}))
in
    TransformedTable
```

## Example of Code

```powerquery
let
    Source = #"Previous Step",
    ColumnasCantidad = List.Select(Table.ColumnNames(Source), each Text.StartsWith(_, "Cantidad")),
    ResultadoFinal = Table.TransformColumnTypes(Source, List.Transform(ColumnasCantidad, each {_, type number}))
in
    ResultadoFinal
```

## Notes

- Adjust `YourTableName` to the name of your source table.
- Replace `"YourPrefix"` with the desired column name prefix (e.g., "Cantidad") to target different prefixes as per your dataset requirements.
- Change `YourDesiredType` to the required data type (e.g., `type number` or `Int64.Type`).
- This formula can be easily modified to use different selection criteria for columns.
